# Comparison-of-CNN-Architectures-on-Different-Datasets
This project compares the performance of seven CNN architectures (LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and SENet) on three image classification datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10). It evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and loss curves, helping to choose the best model for specific tasks.
